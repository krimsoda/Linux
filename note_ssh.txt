#passwordless SSH authentication

First Method:
-Generate a key pair
ssh-keygen
-add public key to remote server
ssh-copy-id
  ssh-copy-id to copy your public key file (or the default id_rsa.pub) to the remote server.
  Once authenticated, your public key will be added to the authorized_keys file on the remote server.
  Appends the public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server, creating it if it doesn't already exist.
  Sets appropriate permissions on the authorized_keys file and the ~/.ssh directory (usually 700 for .ssh and 600 for authorized_keys) to ensure secure access.
Command: ssh-copy-id user@remote ip address

Second Method:
The simplest way to add a public key for a specific username is to manually copy the contents of the public key file (id_rsa.pub or any custom name) 
to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server.
