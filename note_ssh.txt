ssh-keygen - creates a key pair for public key authentication
ssh-copy-id - configures a public key as authorized on a server
ssh-agent - agent to hold private key for single sign-on
ssh-add - tool to add a key to the agent
scp - file transfer client with RCP-like command interface
sftp - file transfer client with FTP-like command interface
sshd - OpenSSH server

#Create SSH Keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa
Once you have generated the keys, they are stored in the /user/home/.ssh/ directory with the following permissions:
    Private key - 600
    Public key - 644



#Transfer Your Public Key to the Server
ssh-copy-id remote_host

Command:
ssh remote_username@remote_host #

Troubleshooting:
systemctl status sshd
ss tulpn | grep 22
/usr/sbin/sshd -t or sshd -t  #Validate the configuration file
/usr/sbin/sshd -T or sshd -T  #Verifying sshd configuration using extended test mode



#passwordless SSH authentication

First Method:
-Generate a key pair
ssh-keygen
-add public key to remote server
ssh-copy-id
  ssh-copy-id to copy your public key file (or the default id_rsa.pub) to the remote server.
  Once authenticated, your public key will be added to the authorized_keys file on the remote server.
  Appends the public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server, creating it if it doesn't already exist.
  Sets appropriate permissions on the authorized_keys file and the ~/.ssh directory (usually 700 for .ssh and 600 for authorized_keys) to ensure secure access.
Command: ssh-copy-id user@remote ip address

Second Method:
The simplest way to add a public key for a specific username is to manually copy the contents of the public key file (id_rsa.pub or any custom name) 
to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server.
